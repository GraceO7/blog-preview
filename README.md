### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Flexbox for layout)
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Responsive design (media queries)
- Google Fonts ([Figtree](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree))


### What I learned


This challenge helped me:
- Improve my understanding of CSS variables for consistent theming.
- Practice using **Flexbox** to build responsive layouts.
- Enhance mobile-first design skills with media queries.

```css
Some css code I'm proud of:
:root {
  --yellow: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --gray-500: hsl(0, 0%, 42%);
  --gray-950: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}
@media(max-width:468px){
    .container{
        margin: 0 40px;
    }
}


```

### Continued development

I plan to focus on:

- Building more complex card layouts using CSS Grid.
- Enhancing accessibility by adding ARIA roles and better focus states.
- Experimenting with SCSS for improved styling workflows.
